# Physics-Guided Continual Learning for Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Battery
This repository contians the dataset and Physics-Guided Continual Learning (PGCL) code reported in the manuscript [Published Journal Link].

## Data Generation 
The `` contians raw dataset documenting the aqueous organic redox flow battery (AORFB) performance with various sampled Aqueous soluble organic (ASO) materials. The data is generated using a 3D interdigiated (ID) cell model with a area of 780 cm^2. 


## PGCL Code
The `PGCL\` contains the code for catastrophic forgetting demo and PGCL testing with various setup.
